        docker is an open source containerization tool that manages isolated environment(container)<br>
        the containers are provided with all the tools and dependencies needed to run a certain software<br>
        the key deference between containerization and virtualization is that a container<br>
        is light weight and a lot more faster to run unlike a virtual machine, the raison for<br>
        this is that the hypervisor virtualize hardware (RAM, CPU, STORAGE ...) and needs a new separate OS<br>

        to run and manage its containers in isolation.<br>
