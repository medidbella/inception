<h3><strong>docker ?</strong></h3>
    <p>
        docker is an open source containerization tool that manages isolated environments(containers)<br>
        the containers are provided with all the tools and dependencies needed to run a certain software<br>
        the key deference between containerization and virtualization is that a container<br>
        is light weight and a lot more faster to run unlike a virtual machine, the raison for<br>
        this is that the hypervisor virtualize hardware (RAM, CPU, STORAGE ...) and needs a new separate OS<br>
        on the other hand docker engine does an OS level virtualization, which means it uses the host kernel<br>
        to run and manage its containers in isolation.<br>
    </p>

<h3>container</h3>
    <p>
        a container is a stand alone executable unit that packages code and dependencies, it shares the OS kernel with <br>
        the host so it does not require an OS per container, which makes it very quickly and efficient <br>
        the docker engine initializes container from a docker image.<br>
